SkillAffirm is a platform designated for custom test creation and skill screening. 
While there are many similar products out there, most are designated only for hiring managers. SkillAffirm’s unique features include candidate dashboards where the candidate is able to send test links directly to the hiring side ( manager, colleague...etc) and request testing.
SkillAffirm’s matching algorithm creates highly accurate skill set tests proven to be exponential for the given job/position.
SkillAffirm also gives the users the ability to fully customize each test.
The initial product launch is scheduled for August 2020. Early beta registration is available <a href="www.skillaffirm.com">here.</a>

                                    <p><strong>Getting Started:</strong>
<br>
<br>

I started my work on the project as early as the Idea state.
<br> 
The idea validation stage took me and the founding members about two months of back and forth interviewing and analyzing processes.
<br>
While initial interviews gave us an overall understanding of our potential user needs they still were only qualitative. Because initially stakeholders wanted to launch the product only for Armenia and test it in a smaller market, all initial research was area based. We faced a hard time finding enough user candidates  that represented our personas.
<br>
A decision was made to try for a bigger market and I went on to conducting online interviews. Two of my free resources  for finding candidates became Facebook groups and Quora threads. There were so many discussions on candidate testing topics so many opinions and pros and cons. It was clear there were two distinct sides: people that were for testing and the ones that were against. 
<br>
I had to separate my research for two user groups 1.)hiring and 2.) candidate:
<br>
<br>
1st group’s questioning showed that 89 out of 100 users were for testing, 40 were already using a paid system, 55 needed custom tests, 38 were willing to pay for tests and 43 would respond to a testing request sent by a candidate.
<br>
<br>
2nd group’s questioning revealed that candidates were less inclined to the concept of testing thus: 55 out of 100 users were for testing, 30 took screening tests previously, 79 were having trouble proving their proficiency, 60 would undergo testing and 45 were willing to send a testing request to the hiring manager (although the concept was unfamiliar).
The results were in the acceptable range to move on to the next step ( the ranges were defined based on our business model calculations).

                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-lg-6">
                                <div class="info">
                                    <p><strong>About The Process:</strong>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
So now we had our personas and value innovation validated, and my team provided a great competitor market analysis  - it was time to move on to the next step. Although it’s better to start the actual wireframes when you actually do have some data on hand - I went ahead and simultaneously created the first very lo-fi wireframes just to have some visuals to lean upon.
 <br>
 <br>
For the MVP we needed to define the most basic and needed features. It was really hard holding back a team of creatives from creating huge feature bucket lists. For that purpose I kept the users flows to the minimum just the crucial interactions.
<br>
<br>
During the interviewing process we discovered that our candidate flow is a potential marketing opportunity, like a free ad send out. We calculated that each candidate user can bring in average 3 new hiring prospects. That discovery gave the email interactions additional impact points.

<br>
You can see two use case interaction wireframes displayed in the top video.
<br>
<br>
Now I won’t describe the lengthy process but we had approximately 300 iterations, 2 rounds of online user testing sessions and it all proved to be worth it.
<br>
<br>
And while at it I want to thank my amazing team for the great effort and passionate work. 
<br>
I will not share the final product screens just yet, will wait for the official launch but will give you a sneak peek into the mobile app screens below.
