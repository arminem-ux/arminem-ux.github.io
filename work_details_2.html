Engine Yard is a platform as a service (PaaS) provider that automates, configures and deploys applications in the cloud. The platform uses Java, Ruby on Rails, PHP and Node.js for both large-scale and small-scale cloud deployments.
Cloud application developers and architects choose Engine Yard for a number of reasons, including self-containment, independent infrastructure and control. Therefore, applications that use Engine Yard's platform are independently contained and do not share infrastructure or virtual machines.

                                    <p><strong>About The Application:</strong>
Originally the Health Check application was part of a bigger platform, in the process we separated it to be a stand alone app due to production costs. The main purpose of the application then became to draw the target audience to the main “paid” Saas portal.
So basically it became a freebie that on a certain level prompts the customer to register on the main Saas while giving moderate value.
The App was designed to give Ruby developers and dev team managers the ability to check their code for multiple vulnerabilities and while providing some low level insights the app prompted them to sign up and get solution options.

                                    <p><strong>About The Process:</strong>


This was one of the rare cases when the initial user testing and feedback gathering was already done by the sales and marketing teams (thank you for that).
<br>
<br>
The old version of the product was outdated and initially the company needed quick, high impact UX changes, which were conducted after a UX review. 
<br>
Next step was creating concepts for a full revamp.
<br>
The information load was too heavy and I had to separate it into stages also because it was a proven working product I didn’t have to reinvent the wheel but rather build upon or rather strip down what already existed.
<br>
<br>
The first stage was the sign up and set up process. 
<br>
Research showed that in 90% of cases users go with a common set of settings, thus it made sense to have the predefined by default and give the users the opportunity to change if needed. That gave me a chance to get rid of multiple steps in the setup process. Also discussions with the product dev team revealed that some of the fields were irrelevant and didn’t hold much value, so I removed those as well. After multiple iterations ( and a lot of discussions) we finally had a set of data that was actually needed to set up a user on the platform.

                                    <p><strong>Process Stage 2:</strong>
To achieve the desired result, I needed to understand how the product operates.
<br>
<br>
Well considering I had no programming background and knew even less about cloud computing, infrustructures, environments and application deployment I had a lot of learning to do.
<br>
My biggest struggle was understanding the relationship between applications and environments and vice versa, because each app could have multiple environments and each environment could have multiple apps and each could have shared environments and apps. I had to find the key element that would hold maximum value for the user. (see "Environment-Application relationship" image below)
<br>
<br>
My take on that issue was giving the user an option to view either via environments or via apps and each view would show the dependencies  with the corresponding alternative.
It was a good start and more iterations and research revealed more in depth insights of the process.

                                    <p><strong>Final Decisions:</strong>
After digesting all the feedback and discussions. I tried a different approach.
<br>
The idea was having mini dashboards of app/environment insights inside the main dashboard  where the user has all the tools and action history. See the final screens below.
<br>
A lot of focus was placed upon UI elements because when you have this much information on one screen each element needs to be precise. One of the biggest challenges was the amount of same hierarchical status UX elements that needed to be differentiated and categorised but still hold their original value.

Working alongside some great minds somehow prompts a leaning urge and for that I am thankful to my colleagues from the product development team for kindly answering my neverending questions.
